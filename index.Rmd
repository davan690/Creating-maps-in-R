# Overview {#overview}

This respository contains a collection of dynamic programming tools and introductory tutorials for dealing with maps and geo-spatical analysis using `rmarkdown and shiny`. This respository contains a collection of dynamic programming tools and introductory tutorials for GIS in R.

## Project objectives

The overall objective is to create a landing page and collection of GIS work in R. All the examples will focus on invasive species dynamics for now but will extend to other areas of ecology and research. The current set of goals for this project also meet the requirements needed to produce the figures for my personal reproducible phd research.

### Objective one

*Produce **static-maps** for the first publication of my PhD.*

#### Datasets

  - Grid locations are in a `kmz` file called "invasive-species-location-research.kmz" [here](data/google-data/invasive-species-location-research.kmz)
    - `kml` file still called "invasive-species-location-research.kmz" [currently](data/google-data/invasive-species-location-research.kmz)
  - Outline of NZ
  - Forest vegetation
  - Data from landCare 2019 publication here

### Objective One

*Produce static maps for the first publication of my PhD.*  Draft here - [Davidson2019a](https://www.ssnhub.com/beech-publication-wr/)

  - Grid locations are can be downloaded as a `kmz` or `kml` file. This is currently labedl "invasive-species-location-research.kml" [here](data/google-data/invasive-species-location-research.kml)
  - NZ basic map examples are here under resources chapter
  - NZ Forest vegetation data comes from ... and saved as "" [here]()

### Objective Two

*Produce static maps for the following data-set* [Davidson2019b] [*same as above*]

### Objective Three

*Produce static maps for the following data-set* [Davidson2019c] [*same as above*]

### Objective Four

**Application for Australian Bushfires**
