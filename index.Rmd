# Preface {-}

This is the very first part of the book. This respositiory is a collection of introductory tutorials for mapping/GIS from a collection on `github` repositories.

- 'creating maps in R': Geocomputational analysis in R and other supporting documents ranging from blogs to scientific publications.

## The objectives

Create a landing page and resource of GIS work in R. With a particular focus on invasive species dynamics. The current goals are as follows:

1. Produce static maps for the first publication of my PhD. [Draft here](https://www.ssnhub.com/2019-05-03-beech-forest-objectives).

- Datasets
  - Grid locations are in a csv file called ""
  - Outline of NZ here ""
  - Forest vegetation here ""
  - Data from landCare 2019 publication here ""

- Rcode
  - My attempt so far ""
  - GIS cheat ""
  - Powerpoint cheat ""

- Static maps
  - NZ beech forest dynamics
  - 8 grids full data
  - only 6 used
  - South Island of NZ

2. Produce static maps for the following data-set (Davidson2019b)

*same as above*

3. Produce static maps for the following data-set (Davidson2019c)

*same as above*
