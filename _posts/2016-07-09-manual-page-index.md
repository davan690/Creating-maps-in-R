## Resource index

There are many many great resources on the web. I have not tried to reproduce good resources but create a collection I can refer to and supplement as new resources and tools become available. These are the key areas so far:

1. [General tools](./general-statistics.md)

2. [Ecological Statistics](./ecological-statistics.md)

3. [Invasive species research](/invasive-species-research.md)

4. [PhD drafts](/thesis-overview.md)

5. [Mapping in R](/creating-maps-in-r/)
