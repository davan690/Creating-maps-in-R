GIS is an area of R coding I have kept away from hoping that I would work it out at a later date. Sadly, it has got to the point where I want to be able to build more complex maps in shiny applications towards the end of my PhD and need to create a base of code to go from. Luckily, the text book "Spatial Analysis in R" has just come out in its second edition and is available in as a bookdown repository including the full text [here](https://bookdown.org/robinlovelace/geocompr/).

This page is a outline of the current resources I am working on and using for my publication and website maps. I have begun by using my normal reproducible workflow and file structure. The full set of resources is currently on a private repository where the resources can be found in the following layout:

1. Produce static maps for the first publication of my PhD. [Draft here](https://www.ssnhub.com/2019-05-03-beech-forest-objectives).

- Datasets
  - Grid locations are in a csv file called ""
  - Outline of NZ here ""
  - Forest vegetation here ""
  - Data from landCare 2019 publication here ""

- Rcode
  - My attempt so far ""
  - GIS cheat ""
  - Powerpoint cheat ""

- Vignettes
  - Creating maps in R ""
  - Book vignettes ""
  - My developing docs ""

- Examples
  - LandCare 2019 publication here ""

- Output
  - So far it looks like this ""

2. Produce static maps for the following data-set (Davidson2019b)

## Resources



- [My git account]()

- [The whole bookdown guide for a start](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_docx.html/): its good but it just seems that an independent blog or `a stack-overflow` feed is easier to find the answers in. A good start to begin to build RMarkdown documents quickly.

### DOCx fun!

I hate to think currently but there are many options around this using a range of workflows. The final copy will render to 'PDF' and each chapter draft will be edited etc in docx files. This is all possible however rendering the entire thesis as one in word is likely to have issues. IF this will be a problem I will need to sort this as soon as possible.
