```r

```

Using and applying GIS techniques in R has become much easier since the additional functionality of Java-script libraries. One of these libraries in the `leaflet` library for mapping. Below are some examples of these mapping tools with examples.

# Resources

I like the idea of know what to do in arcGIS so that it is easy to work with researchers that use either R or arcGIS. For a GIS map there are two main options. Here are the resources for building interactive and static maps in R using a range of different packages:

- 'leaflet`

### A single location on a map

Here is the birthplace of R plotted with `leaflet`, `addTiles` and the `addMarkers`...



### Leaflet plot options

*still coming*

## My Notes

I have sent the following to Matt to input into arcGIS and compare rendered maps.


```r
# grid.locations <- 
# label
```

*add hand drawn image here*

### Extracting mymaps data

This is for security reasons.
