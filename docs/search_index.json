All the examples will focus on invasive species dynamics for now but will extend to other areas of ecology and research. The current set of goals for this project also meet the requirements needed to produce the figures for my personal reproducible phd research. 1.1.1 Objective One Produce static maps for the first publication of my PhD.

["introduction.html", " 2 Introduction 2.1 Data", " 2 Introduction Creating maps using spatial data in R GIS is an area of R coding I have kept away from hoping that I would work it out at a later date. Sadly, it has got to the point where I want to be able to build more complex maps in shiny applications towards the end of my PhD and need to create a base of code to go from. Luckily, the text book “Spatial Analysis in R” has just come out in its second edition and is available in as a bookdown repository including the full text here. This page is a outline of the current resources I am working on and using for my publication and website maps. I have begun by using my normal reproducible workflow and file structure. The full set of resources is currently on a private repository. 2.1 Data {: .box-note} Note: This can currently me modified and changed by anyone with the link. As it comes more important for the dataset to not be modified by others we will tighten this process up using the leaflet and shiny app process we are using for the mapping and analysis at the bottom of this post.

["divingin.html", " 3 Diving In 3.1 kml to tidy dataset", " 3 Diving In There are plenty of github repositories explaining the different types of GIS and using R. Below is the public google-my-maps map that can be modified an worked on from within the window provided below. 3.1 kml to tidy dataset Import data from downloaded kml file from the my-maps data. Download the kml file from online (NOT the kmz file) {.:Note} A KMZ file is just a zipped KML file, possibly with associated embedded images, icons, etc. So any program that supports KMZ files internally unzips them to access their KML files. That may be a reason why many open source programs do not bother supporting KMZ once KML support is implemented: you just need to use an additional unzipping library of your choice, to convert the KMZ to KML. The linked posts give some JavaScript-based solutions for unzipping. source(&quot;./R/kml_to_tidy.R&quot;) ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.2.1 -- ## v ggplot2 3.2.1 v readr 1.3.1 ## v tibble 2.1.3 v purrr 0.3.2 ## v tidyr 0.8.3 v stringr 1.4.0 ## v ggplot2 3.2.1 v forcats 0.4.0 ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() ## Multiple layers are present in data source C:\\Code\\Creating-maps-in-R\\data\\invasive-species-NAH-research.kml, reading layer `Hollyford&#39;. ## Use `st_layers&#39; to list all layer names and their type in a data source. ## Set the `layer&#39; argument in `st_read&#39; to read a particular layer. ## Warning in evalq((function (..., call. = TRUE, immediate. = FALSE, ## noBreaks. = FALSE, : automatically selected the first layer in a data ## source containing more than one. ## Reading layer `Hollyford&#39; from data source `C:\\Code\\Creating-maps-in-R\\data\\invasive-species-NAH-research.kml&#39; using driver `KML&#39; ## Simple feature collection with 10 features and 2 fields ## geometry type: GEOMETRY ## dimension: XYZ ## bbox: xmin: 167.9963 ymin: -45.06019 xmax: 168.1392 ymax: -44.70935 ## epsg (SRID): 4326 ## proj4string: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs ## Observations: 10 ## Variables: 3 ## $ Name &lt;fct&gt; Gunns Camp, Choqenout and Ruscoe 2000, Hollyford V... ## $ Description &lt;fct&gt; &quot;&quot;, &quot;Eglinton Valley&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;,... ## $ geometry &lt;GEOMETRY [°]&gt; POINT Z (168.1392 -44.76039 0), POINT Z (... tidy.kat ## # A tibble: 12 x 7 ## folder name description styleUrl longitude latitude altitude ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Hollyford Gunns Camp &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.8 0 ## 2 Hollyford Choqenout~ Eglinton V~ #icon-1899~ 168. -45.1 0 ## 3 Hollyford Hollyford~ &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.8 0 ## 4 Hollyford Hollyford~ &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.7 0 ## 5 Hollyford Point 9 &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.8 0 ## 6 Hollyford Point 10 x = 10, y ~ #icon-1899~ 168. -44.9 0 ## 7 Eglinton~ MR1 &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.9 0 ## 8 Eglinton~ M1 &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.9 0 ## 9 Eglinton~ M1 &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.9 0 ## 10 Eglinton~ R1 &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.9 0 ## 11 Eglinton~ MR1 &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.9 0 ## 12 Eglinton~ R1 &lt;NA&gt; #icon-1899~ 168. -44.9 0 3.1.1 Save Save csv data for arcGIS work from here as: write.csv(tidy.kat, &quot;./data/kml_tidy_data.csv&quot;) "],

See here for the complete set. As a convenience, leaflet also provides a named list of all the third-party tile providers that are supported by the plugin. This enables you to use auto-completion feature of your favorite R IDE (like RStudio) and not have to remember or look up supported tile providers; just type providers$ and choose from one of the options. You can also use names(providers) to view all of the options. m %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.Toner) m %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$CartoDB.Positron) m %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap) Note that some tile set providers require you to register; see the project page for more information. You can pass access tokens/keys, and other options, to the tile provider by populating the options argument with the providerTileOptions() function. 6.3.3 Custom Tile URL Template If you happen to have a custom map tile URL template to use, you can provide it as an argument to addTiles(). 6.3.4 WMS Tiles You can use addWMSTiles() to add WMS (Web Map Service) tiles. The map below shows the Base Reflectivity (a measure of the intensity of precipitation occurring) using the WMS from the Iowa Environmental Mesonet: leaflet() %&gt;% addTiles() %&gt;% setView(-93.65, 42.0285, zoom = 4) %&gt;% addWMSTiles( &quot;http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/cgi-bin/wms/nexrad/n0r.cgi&quot;, layers = &quot;nexrad-n0r-900913&quot;, options = WMSTileOptions(format = &quot;image/png&quot;, transparent = TRUE), attribution = &quot;Weather data © 2012 IEM Nexrad&quot; ) 6.3.5 Combining Tile Layers You aren’t restricted to using a single basemap on a map; you can stack them by adding multiple tile layers. This generally only makes sense if the front tiles consist of semi transparent tiles, or have an adjusted opacity via the options argument. m %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$MtbMap) %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLines, options = providerTileOptions(opacity = 0.35)) %&gt;% addProviderTiles(providers$Stamen.TonerLabels) 6.4 Choropleths Making choropleths with leaflet is easy. In this example, we’ll duplicate the step-by-step choropleth tutorial from the Leaflet.js website. The final result will look like this (scroll to the end to see the completed code): ## [1] &quot;SpatialPolygonsDataFrame&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;sp&quot; 6.4.1 Data source We’ll start by loading the data from JSON. While the Leaflet.js example loads the JSON directly into JavaScript, with the Leaflet R package we instead want to load the data into R. In this case, we’ll use the geojsonio package to load the data into sp objects, which will let us easily manipulate the geographic features, and their properties, in R. # states &lt;- geojsonio::geojson_read(&quot;json/us-states.geojson&quot;, what = &quot;sp&quot;) class(states) ## [1] &quot;SpatialPolygonsDataFrame&quot; ## attr(,&quot;package&quot;) ## [1] &quot;sp&quot; names(states) ## [1] &quot;id&quot; &quot;name&quot; &quot;density&quot; As you can see, we now have a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame with name (state name) and density (population density in people/mi2) columns from the GeoJSON. 6.4.2 Basic states map Next, let’s make a basic map with just the outline of the states. For our basemap, we’ll use the same \"mapbox.light\" MapBox style that the example does; if you don’t have a MapBox account, you can just use addTiles() in place of the addProviderTiles call, or choose a free provider. m &lt;- leaflet(states) %&gt;% setView(-96, 37.8, 4) %&gt;% addProviderTiles(&quot;MapBox&quot;, options = providerTileOptions( id = &quot;mapbox.light&quot;, accessToken = Sys.getenv(&#39;MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN&#39;))) We’ve saved the basic basemap as a separate variable m so we can easily iterate on the addPolygons call as we work through the rest of the tutorial. To add uniform polygons with default styling, just call addPolygons with no additional arguments. m %&gt;% addPolygons() 6.4.3 Adding some color Now, let’s color the states according to their population density. You have various options for mapping data to colors; for this example we’ll match the Leaflet.js tutorial by mapping a specific set of bins into RColorBrewer colors. First, we’ll define the bins. This is a numeric vector that defines the boundaries between intervals ((0,10], (10,20], and so on). Then, we’ll call colorBin to generate a palette function that maps the RColorBrewer \"YlOrRd\" colors to our bins. Finally, we’ll modify addPolygons to use the palette function and the density values to generate a vector of colors for fillColor, and also add some other static style properties. bins &lt;- c(0, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, Inf) pal &lt;- colorBin(&quot;YlOrRd&quot;, domain = states$density, bins = bins) m %&gt;% addPolygons( fillColor = ~pal(density), weight = 2, opacity = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;, dashArray = &quot;3&quot;, fillOpacity = 0.7) 6.4.4 Adding interaction The next thing we’ll want is to make the polygons highlight as the mouse passes over them. The addPolygon function has a highlight argument that makes this simple. m %&gt;% addPolygons( fillColor = ~pal(density), weight = 2, opacity = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;, dashArray = &quot;3&quot;, fillOpacity = 0.7, highlight = highlightOptions( weight = 5, color = &quot;#666&quot;, dashArray = &quot;&quot;, fillOpacity = 0.7, bringToFront = TRUE)) (The Leaflet.js tutorial also adds an event handler that zooms into a state when it’s clicked. This isn’t currently possible with the Leaflet R package, except with either custom JavaScript or using Shiny, both of which are outside the scope of this example.) 6.4.5 Custom info Now let’s expose the state names and values to the user. The Leaflet.js tutorial shows the hovered-over state’s information in a custom control. Again, that’s possible by adding custom JavaScript or using Shiny, but for this example we’ll use the built-in labels feature instead. We’ll generate the labels by handcrafting some HTML, and passing it to lapply(htmltools::HTML) so that Leaflet knows to treat each label as HTML instead of as plain text. We’ll also set some label options to improve the style of the label element itself. labels &lt;- sprintf( &quot;&lt;strong&gt;%s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;%g people / mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&quot;, states$name, states$density ) %&gt;% lapply(htmltools::HTML) m &lt;- m %&gt;% addPolygons( fillColor = ~pal(density), weight = 2, opacity = 1, color = &quot;white&quot;, dashArray = &quot;3&quot;, fillOpacity = 0.7, highlight = highlightOptions( weight = 5, color = &quot;#666&quot;, dashArray = &quot;&quot;, fillOpacity = 0.7, bringToFront = TRUE), label = labels, labelOptions = labelOptions( style = list(&quot;font-weight&quot; = &quot;normal&quot;, padding = &quot;3px 8px&quot;), textsize = &quot;15px&quot;, direction = &quot;auto&quot;)) m This is the final version of our polygon layer, so let’s save the result back to the m variable. 6.4.6 Legend As our final step, let’s add a legend. Because we chose to color our map using colorBin, the addLegend function makes it particularly easy to add a legend with the correct colors and intervals. m %&gt;% addLegend(pal = pal, values = ~density, opacity = 0.7, title = NULL, position = &quot;bottomright&quot;) 6.5 A single location on a map Here is the birthplace of R plotted with leaflet, addTiles and the addMarkers… 6.6 Leaflet plots still coming 6.7 My Notes I have sent the following colleagues to input into arcGIS and compare rendered maps/workflow issues with reproducibililty.
