The current goals under my PhD work is as follows: One: Produce static maps for the first publication of my PhD.

One of these libraries in the leaflet library for mapping. Below are some examples of these mapping tools with examples. "],

For a GIS map there are two main options. Here are the resources for building interactive and static maps in R using a range of different packages: ’leaflet` 4.0.1 A single location on a map Here is the birthplace of R plotted with leaflet, addTiles and the addMarkers… 4.0.2 Leaflet plot options still coming 4.1 My Notes I have sent the following to Matt to input into arcGIS and compare rendered maps. # grid.locations &lt;- # label add hand drawn image here 4.1.1 Extracting mymaps data This is for security reasons. library(leaflet) library(leaflet.extras) "],
