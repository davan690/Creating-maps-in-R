# Overview {#overview}

This respository contains a collection of dynamic programming tools and introductory tutorials for mapping/GIS from the following `github` repositories:

- [Creating maps in R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/): A textbook on geocomputational analysis in R
- [MapView](https://r-spatial.github.io/mapview/): a 3D interactive R packages
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMi1ThlGFMo)

## Project objectives

The overall objective is to create a landing page and collection of GIS work in R. All the examples will focus on invasive species dynamics. The current goals that also meet the requirements to produce the figures needed for reproducible phd research.

One: *Produce static maps for the first publication of my PhD.* 

Draft here - [Davidson2019a](https://www.ssnhub.com/2019-05-03-beech-forest-objectives)

- Datasets
  - Grid locations are in a `kml` file called "" [here]()
  - Outline of NZ here "" [here]()
  - Forest vegetation here "" [here]()
  - Data from landCare 2019 publication here "" [here]()

- Rcode
